**Fringe** is an easy workaround for Google Workplace users who need a Radius server to perform authentication on behalf of
other services (e.g. 802.1X Wi-Fi, vpn server). 

The fringe service offers both a http and radius server. 
* The web interface allows authenticated users (through Google Oauth) to generate and refresh a randomly generated 
password (only for users in a pecific email domain). 
* The radius server authenticate the user using email and generated password.
